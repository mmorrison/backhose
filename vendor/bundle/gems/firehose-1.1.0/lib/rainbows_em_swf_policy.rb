# This file file monkeypatches Rainbows! to return a proper SWF policy file.
# Enable this with something like this in your config/rainbows.rb file:
#
#     after_fork do |server, worker|
#       require 'rainbows_em_swf_policy'
#     end if ENV['RACK_ENV'] == 'development'
#
# You should only use this in development. It has not been well tested in a
# production environment.
#
# NOTE: This only works if you are using Rainbows! with EventMachine.
